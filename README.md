- The backend directory will contain server configurations, API routes, models, and a database connection setup.

## Features

- **Product Browsing:** Users can view all products, with functionalities to filter by category and sort by price.
- **User Authentication:** Features for user registration and login, enabling personalized experiences like profile management.
